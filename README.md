# Firebase Data Streaming
This is a repository where i am uploading my project codes.

Explanation of Firebase Data Streaming project code is overhere.

--> Int this code i create "device" as a parent node and in that node "t" & "x" are child node of that. Using that child node data i created another parent node which is "Darshnik"
and according to t and x values data d1,... & n1,... child nodes will create in parent node "Darshnik".

Example:- device 
              t=2
              x=3
          then
          Darshnik
              d1
              d2
              n1
              n2
              n3
will create in firebase.

So this is whole explanation.

Thank you.
